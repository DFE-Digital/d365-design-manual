<p class="govuk-body">Power Pages sites can carry either the DfE or GOV.UK brand, but predominantly use GOV.UK design patterns and frontend code. 
  Because Power Pages has its own layout and built-in constraints, this site shows how to adapt those patterns and code examples for GOV.UK and DfE styles on Power Pages.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Design system coverage</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">All styles, components and patterns here come from the GOV.UK Design System, tailored for Power Pages. Many other static GOV.UK elements (for example, table HTML) work out-of-the-box and don't require customisation â€” just drop them in as documented.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Products on the service.gov.uk domain</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">If your product is hosted on the service.gov.uk domain, you must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use the GOV.UK header</li>
  <li>use GDS Transport typeface</li>
  <li>meet the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition" target="_blank">GOV.UK Proposition (opens in a new tab)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Products on the education.gov.uk domain</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">For products hosted on education.gov.uk, and internal staff facing products built by DfE teams, you must:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>use the DfE header</li>
  <li>show the DfE logo in the header</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://standards.education.gov.uk/standard/digital-product-branding#toleratedproducts" target="_blank">tolerated instances (opens in a new tab)</a> where this is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Existing products that do not meet this standard, and are not an exception, must include alignment to the standard as part of their product roadmap.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When you need to meet this standard</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">New products and those in development must meet this standard at their launch from public beta.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to consider when applying this standard</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Engage early with content and interaction designers to ensure branding choices are integrated into your service's overall user experience.</li>
  <li>Understand and review the design system and proposition guidelines during development to ensure compliance before launch.</li>
</ul>
