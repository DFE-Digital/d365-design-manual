<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Dynamics 365 Design Manual components are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>based on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/" target="_blank">GOV.UK Design System (opens in a new tab)</a> components</li>
    <li>suitable for use with Dynamics 365 portal services</li>   
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You can use these individual components in many different patterns and contexts. For example, you can use the text input component to ask for an 
    email address, a National Insurance number or someone's name. These component types have been broken down for specific use cases on Dynamics 365 portals.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you require a component which is not included in the list below, <a class="govuk-link" href="/portals/patterns">refer to the patterns included in 
    this manual</a> in the first instance. Some of the general use components, for example, breadcrumbs and error summary, are already embedded in within the liquid template layouts. The 
    patterns section will advise how to work with these components.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">For all other components, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/" target="_blank">GOV.UK 
    Design System (opens in a new tab)</a>. These will not require any customisation to work with D365 portals other than changing the content in the example HTML to meet your 
    specific requirements.</p>
