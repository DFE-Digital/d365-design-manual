<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use this component</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">{{ pageDescription }}</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to not use this component</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not use the radios component if users might need to select more than one option. In this case, you should use the checkboxes component instead.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Always position radios to the left of their labels. This makes them easier to find, especially for users of screen magnifiers.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Unlike with checkboxes, users can only select one option from a list of radios. Do not assume that users will know how many options they can 
  select based on the visual difference between radios and checkboxes alone.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If needed, add a hint explaining this, for example, 'Select one option'.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not pre-select radio options as this makes it more likely that users will not realise they've missed a question or submitted the wrong answer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Users cannot go back to having no option selected once they have selected one, without refreshing their browser window. Therefore, you should include 'None of the above' or 'I do not know' if they are valid options.</p>  
<p class="govuk-body">Order radio options alphabetically by default.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Copy and amend the HTML examples</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Choose the appropriate example from this page and copy the HTML directly into your web template. <a class="govuk-link" href="../layouts">Read about layouts</a>
  for more information about how to structure your web template.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If the component needs to submit to a field in CRM, replace the highlighted <code>schema-name</code> text in the example 
  HTML with the target field schema name. <strong>Do not</strong> remove any prepended or appended text to the schema name. For example, if the id attribute is 
  displayed as <code>schema-name-error</code> in the example, the value should still contain <code>-error</code> after the schema name has been replaced (<code>dfe_field-error</code>).</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This step is essential for the custom portal helper framework to validate and submit data to CRM. <a class="govuk-link" href="">Read about data validation and submitting data to CRM</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are asking one question on the page</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If you are asking just one question on the page, set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it 
  means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You will need to include an empty <code>&#123;% title %&#125;</code> block in your web template to override the default page header.</p>

{{ radioHeaderExample() }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are asking more than one question on the page</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If you're asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading.</p>

{{ radioStandardExample() }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hint text</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Use hint text for help that's relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it. The hint text block is included in the previous examples on this page.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Hint text is not mandatory, and can be removed if it is not required.</p>

{{ radioNoHintExample() }}

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">When not to use hint text</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not use long paragraphs and lists in hint text. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the form element. 
  This could frustrate users if the text is long.</p>

<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Avoid links in hint text</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they will not tell users that 
  the text is a link.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Inline radios</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">In some cases, you can choose to display radios 'inline' beside one another (horizontally). Only use inline radios when the question only has 
  two options or both options are short.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">On small screens such as mobile devices, the radios will still be 'stacked' on top of one another (vertically).</p>

{{ radioInlineExample() }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Radio items with hints</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You can add hints to radio items to provide additional information about the options.</p>

{{ radioItemHintExample() }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Radio items with a text divider</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If one or more of your radio options is different from the others, it can help users if you separate them using a text divider. The text is usually the word 'or'.</p>

{{ radioTextDividerExample() }}

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Conditionally revealing a related question</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You can ask the user a related question when they select a particular radio option, so they only see the question when it's relevant to them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This might make two related questions easier to answer by grouping them on the same page. For example, you could reveal a phone number input when the user selects the 'Contact me by phone' option.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Keep it simple. If the related question is complicated or has more than one part, show it on the next page in the process instead.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not conditionally reveal questions to inline radios, such as 'yes' and 'no' options placed next to each other.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Conditionally reveal questions only - do not show or hide anything that is not a question.</p>

{{ radioConditionalQuestionExample() }}

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    Your schema names are likely to be different for your related questions. Using the above code example as reference, your 'Text message' option and related 'Mobile phone number' input 
    are likely to have different schema names if you are submitting both values to fields in the CRM database. Be aware of this when replacing the <code>schema-name</code> placeholder values.
  </strong>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Error messages</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">An error message is shown next to the field and in the error summary when there is a validation error. The HTML content for these errors is already 
  included in the component examples and in the base portal web template set up, therefore you do not need to add any additional error containers to your page.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The <a class="govuk-link" href="#">portal helper framework</a> validation process automatically handles error messages for specific error states.</p>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">If nothing is selected and the question is required</p>
<p class="govuk-body">'Select [whatever it is]'.<br><br>For example, 'Select where you live'.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Occasionally you may wish to use error messages outside of the validation process. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="">read about the functions available within the portal helper framework</a> to help you with this.</p>
