<!-- 

  - This template renders the home page with a two column layout. The left column is wider than the right
    Breadcrumbs are not required on the home page, so they have been hidden using an empty breadcrumbs block
    It contains an updated title block with a placeholder for the service title
    The main content is located in the left column
    A user check has been added. The home page should contain content variations for a logged out service landing page and a signed in user landing page.

  - Replace the content of the 'Home' web template with the code below

  - Rename the template to 'DfE/Home'
